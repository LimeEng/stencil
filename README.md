# Stencil

Quickly generate a basic Rust project with github workflows setup.

## Installation

If [cargo and rust are installed](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), you can download and install the latest commit on master by running the following command:
```
cargo install --git https://github.com/LimeEng/stencil
```

Another possibility is to download a pre-built binary from the [releases-page](https://github.com/LimeEng/stencil/releases).
